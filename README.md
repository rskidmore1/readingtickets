# readingtickets
An approach to reading tickets.

#### Preticket.
1. Make out line of details 
2. Make summary of my understanding ign of details 
3. Ask owner about every possible assumption
4. Write a very detailed and bullet pointed ticket 

#### 1. Reading the ticket slowly and write it out 
- Read it at least 3 times out loud 
- Take notes about steps, any  and all thoughts, missing information, everthing 
- Make a list of steps and takes based on the information there and reasonable extrapolation 

#### 2. Explore
- Read code where is will go
- Make sudo code in comments 
  - Where code will go 
  - Considerations 

#### 3. Code 10% of solution
- Start coding based on the information in ticket
- Take notes on consideration 
- Formualate quesitons and assumptions about missing information 

#### 4. Ask questions 
- Am I going the right directions? 
- Do  things work how I think they work?

#### 5. Code the rest of the solution 
- Re-read the ticket and make updates
- Make my own list of tasks in a word doc and follow that
#### 6. Check in once a day with my progress and next steps 
- Are next steps correct?


----------------------------------------------
Tickets will not always be clear and thoughts finished, but there will  be enough information  to start in a  direction. Taking notes and starting is  the best way to answer  basic quesiton  in order  to  make good ones. 
Part of the job of software engineering is to gather details and fill in the blanks with coding that solves the problem even when the details are fuzzy and the tickets are not well written. The senior dev or product owner will know the next step when asked the right question. Or  the software engineer will  know that their solution  is the right one because there is not detailed intention from the ticket writer.
