# readingtickets
An approach to reading tickets.

#### Preticket.
1. Make outline of details based on description from Owner
2. Make summary of my understanding of details 
3. Ask owner about every possible assumption
4. Write a very detailed and bullet pointed ticket 

#### 1. Reading the ticket slowly and write it out 
- Read it at least 3 times out loud 
- Take notes about steps, any  and all thoughts, missing information, everthing 
- Make a list of steps and takes based on the information there and reasonable extrapolation 
- Ask Owner if these are still correct

#### 2. Explore
- Read code where is will go
- Make sudo code in comments 
  - Where code will go 
  - Considerations 

#### 3. Code 10% of solution
- Start coding based on the information in ticket
- Take notes on consideration 
- Formualate quesitons and assumptions about missing information 

#### 4. Ask questions 
- Create stages to check in with the owner at 
- Ask if all details are stil correct

#### 5. Code the rest of the solution 
- Check in with Owner at each stage

#### 6. Check in once a day with my progress and next steps 
- Are next steps correct?


----------------------------------------------
Tickets will not always be clear and thoughts finished, but there will  be enough information  to start in a  direction. Taking notes and starting is  the best way to answer  basic quesiton  in order  to  make good ones. 
Part of the job of software engineering is to gather details and fill in the blanks with coding that solves the problem even when the details are fuzzy and the tickets are not well written. The senior dev or product owner will know the next step when asked the right question. Or  the software engineer will  know that their solution  is the right one because there is not detailed intention from the ticket writer. 

Ben:
Check in with larger projects. 
I said to ben I was going to make things in stages so he can review the code. 
I said to ben I was going to check in at smaller intervals.

Jerome:
I need to stop feature creep 
Talk to the stake holders, talk to Brooke to see who is the right person to talk to. Start at the top of the chain of command. 
Ben is really good with the technical stuff, but
Trace how things move through the stack. (I DO THIS BEFORE ASKIGN A QUESTION) 
I should challenge ben on features and how they are implemented.
Make issue super bullet-pointed, just do what is in that, anything more is feature creep and needs to be in a different issue 
Recycle UI elements as much as possible. 

Other:
Make my PRs smaller. I should have made end points smaller. (Maybe I can do that if I make things in stages. I also i can make a working copy as I get better at using vue and symfony
Create more issues if scope becomes too big.
