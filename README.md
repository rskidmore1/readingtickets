# readingtickets
An approach to reading tickets.

#### Preticket.
1. Make outline of details based on description from Owner
2. Make summary of my understanding of details 
3. Ask owner about every possible assumption
4. Write a very detailed and bullet pointed ticket 

#### 1. Reading the ticket slowly and write it out 
- Read it at least 3 times out loud 
- Take notes about steps, any  and all thoughts, missing information, everthing 
- Make a list of steps and takes based on the information there and reasonable extrapolation 
- Ask Owner if these are still correct

#### 2. Explore
- Read code where it will go
- Make sudo code in comments 

#### 3. Code 10% of solution
- Start coding based on the information in ticket
- Take notes on consideration 
- Formualate quesitons and assumptions about missing information 

#### 4. Ask more questions 
- Create stages to check in with the owner at 
- Ask if all details are stil correct

#### 5. Start coding  
- Check in with Owner at each stage to adjust work 
- Create small PR as each stage or section is complete 

#### 6. Further changes 
- Make more tickets for things that are out of scope 
- Make PRs for changes to things that have already been merged

#### 7. Check in once a day with my progress and next steps 
- Check in on progress of each stage


----------------------------------------------
Tickets will not always be clear and thoughts finished, but there will be enough information to start in a  direction. Taking notes and starting is the best way to answer basic quesiton in order to make good ones. 
Part of the job of software engineering is to gather details and fill in the blanks with coding that solves the problem even when the details are fuzzy and the tickets sparcely written. The senior dev or product owner will know the next step when asked the right question. 

Ben:
Check in with larger projects to make sure I am moving in the right direction. 
I said to ben I was going to make things in smaller stages so he can review the code. 
I said to ben I was going to check in at smaller intervals.

Jerome:
I need to stop feature creep 
Talk to the stake holders, talk to Brooke to see who is the right person to talk to. Start at the top of the chain of command. 
Ben is really good with and attentive to the technical stuff, but...
Trace how things move through the stack.
I should challenge Ben on features and how they are implemented.
Make issues super bullet-pointed, just do what is in that, anything more is feature creep and needs to be in a different issue 
Recycle UI elements as much as possible. 

Other:
Make my PRs smaller. I should have made end points smaller. (Maybe I can do that if I make things in stages. I also i can make a working copy as I get better at using vue and symfony.)
Create more issues if scope becomes too big.
