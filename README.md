An approach to reading tickets.


#### 1. Reading the ticket slowly and write it out 
- Read it at least 3 times out loud 
- Take notes about steps, any  and all thoughts, missing information, everthing 
- Make a list of steps and takes based on the information there and reasonable extrapolation 

#### 2. Explore
- Read code where is will go
- Make sudo code in comments 
  - Where code will go 
  - Considerations 

#### 3. Code 10% of solution
- Start coding based on the information in ticket
- Take notes on consideration 
- Formualate quesitons and assumptions about missing information 

#### 4. Ask questions 
- Am I going the right directions? 
- Do  things work how I think they work?

#### 5. Code the rest of the solution 
#### 6. Check in once a day with my progress and next steps 
- Are next steps correct?


Tickets will always be clear and thoughts finished, but there will  be enough information  to start in a  direction. Taking notes and starting is  the best way to answer  basic quesiton  in order  to  make good ones.
